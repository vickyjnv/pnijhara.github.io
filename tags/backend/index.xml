      <description>API1 or the Application Programming interface is the middlepoint between App2 and data or it is a gateway to DataBase.
API governs the access point(s) for the server, that means instead of directly sending request to DataBase, API checks your identity and type of request and pass it through some logic filter and then reflect your request/change to the DataBase.
From the above diagram you can clearly see that, every request passes through a middleware(API) and then API performs some action/ checks validation and pass your request to DataBase to let it give you your desired response.</description>

With this, this blog series will focus on building a strong and easily maintainable API with FastAPI framework of Python. I&amp;rsquo;ll be specifically focusing on best practices that every developer should must follow.</description>
