      <description>Special thanks to events that occurred during this semester and a special thanks to the people who came and left from my life. Those events and people created an unwanted strong impact on my life and taught me how to live life and how to inspire yourself. Though, because of them, I could have easily made my life a misery which I almost did. However, a resolution and special event stopped me to that.</description>
