      <description>Aligarh Muslim University, the university I chose to pursue my bachelor&#39;s degree. It was not an easy decision, but somehow I managed to get in there. Electrical Engineering was never on my list, but when you are unable to get your dream branch you have to be satisfied with what your faith is. So, here I am studying Electrical Engineering at AMU.
First month, away from home was like jumping straight into hell.</description>
