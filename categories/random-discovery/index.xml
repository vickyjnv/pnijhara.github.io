      <description>NOTE : This post originally appeared on techcodemonk.in, and has been posted here with due permission
 In continuation with the blog Web Scrapping with Python by Kamran which explained briefly about what web scraping is. The blog was focused on Python programming language. However, here in this article we will be expanding our scope and try to write exactly like the last blog but with Nodejs. We will be (again) building an IMDB Scraper but this time with Nodejs.</description>

      <description>Well, I am not writing this blog because I have used Hugo for making my website. It is just that I wanted to compare the powers of Hugo and Jekyll. There is a whole list of static site generators you can use and some of them are listed here. However, I am just comparing these 2 as they are widely used.
 NOTE: I too don&amp;rsquo;t know why I chose Hugo over Jekyll for making this website.</description>

      <description>Special thanks to events that occurred during this semester and a special thanks to the people who came and left from my life. Those events and people created an unwanted strong impact on my life and taught me how to live life and how to inspire yourself. Though, because of them, I could have easily made my life a misery which I almost did. However, a resolution and special event stopped me to that.</description>

      <description>In the last article, I tried to cover almost every point required for creating your blog. However, there are still some points left which remain uncovered in the previous section.
This article will cover those points which I feel are not covered in the official documentation or if covered are not much focussed in there quick start guide.
Point 1 Most of the time I read questions on the internet of people asking that even after creating or copying the config.</description>
