      <description>Recently I got the privilege to write an article for a non-governmental organisation named @lovenation_hme of Indian Institute of Law, Indore.

Article Religion is supposed to be the means of attaining peace but in practicality, in reality, today every religion has got a base of fundamentalism and involvement of terrorism.</description>
