      <title>Semester 1 Report</title>

      <description>Aligarh Muslim University, the university I chose to pursuing my bachelor&#39;s. It was not an easy decision, but somehow I managed to get in there. Electrical Engineering was never on my list, but when you are unable to get your dream branch you have to be satisfied with what your faith is. So, here I am studying Electrical Engineering at AMU.
First month, away from home was like jumping straight into hell.</description>

      <title>Journey to SIH-19</title>
      <link>https://pnijhara.me/2020/01/journey-to-sih-19/</link>

      <guid>https://pnijhara.me/2020/01/journey-to-sih-19/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This blog is all about the steps which I and my team &lt;strong&gt;Narcodes&lt;/strong&gt; took for getting selected in the SIH-19 software edition. Along with the steps we took, this blog also covers the points/steps which were mandatory for each team. Hence, the following blog aims for making the journey for SIH-2020 a bit easy for the new teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, the journey for SIH-19 started with the formation of a team. The team consisted of 6 members from the same college. However, each team was asked to have a female member and a leader. Next, we encoutered our first task to select a problem statement to work on and choose the right problem from tons of problems which was quite a difficult task!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then came the team registration step and we got our team registered. The team registration step was also not a simple task. The team was registered by the team leader on the SIH-19 website. Moreover, the team&#39;s registration got the green signal only when the SPOC (Single Point of Contact) gave his approval to the team. Hence, it was the duty of the team to submit their team members&amp;rsquo; information forwarded by the Head of the college to the SPOC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last and the important step was to write the SOP for the problem statements which were approved by the SPOC(based on an internal hackathon, where each team was asked to give a pitch on there SOP) before submitting it to the  SIH-19&#39;s SOP submission portal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, to summarize the whole process, let us break it into points&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Team formation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Choosing the right problem statements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Team Registration
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Team registration by the team leader&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contact SPOC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Approval by SPOC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Internal Hackathon
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SOP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pitch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Submission of SOP by the team leader&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Approval by  SPOC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NOTE: I am not sure that whether these steps would be followed for SIH-2020 nor I am sure about the upcoming internal Hackthon procedure. They may get change this year. For more information please visit &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sih.gov.in/about&#34;&gt;SIH-2020 website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Hugo vs Jekyll: A comparison based on personal usage</title>

      <description>Well, I am not writing this blog because I have used Hugo for making my website. It is just that I wanted to compare the powers of Hugo and Jekyll. There is a whole list of static-site generators you can use and some of them are listed here. However, I am just comparing these 2 as they are widely used.
 NOTE: I too don&#39;t know why I chose Hugo over Jekyll for making this website.</description>

      <title>ROC &amp; Special Thanks</title>

      <description>Special thanks to events that occurred during this semester and a special thanks to the people who came and left from my life. Those events and people created an unwanted strong impact on my life and taught me how to live life and how to inspire yourself. Though, because of them, I could have easily made my life a misery which I almost did. However, a resolution and special event stopped me to that.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Started this blogging website to summarize my learning weakly. However, due to some social issues and college work, I was not able to keep up the work. A list that I prepared for learning and writing was not followed by me. Though now I cannot summarize the whole semester learnings weakly, I decided to summarize them semester wise till now starting from my journey to college that is from 1st sem to 3rd sem. The three blog series will cover almost all the topics from starting my journey at Aligarh Muslim Unversity to me as a 3rd semester studying Electrical Engineering student, from technical learnings to life lessons, from hackathons to club etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from that, I will be resuming my weekly writings from 2020. Hope that would be a great start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, I have removed links of Instagram and facebook from this website as I am not continuing them. You can connect me on the mail or via twitter.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Recently I got the privilege to write an article for a non-governmental organisation named @lovenation_hme of Indian Institute of Law, Indore. The organisation aims to create unity among religions as being the responsible and literate citizens of India. The organisation also states that &amp;ldquo;India is ours and we are proud citizens of India&amp;rdquo;.
Article Religion is supposed to be the means of attaining peace but in practicality, in reality, today every religion has got a base of fundamentalism and involvement of terrorism.</description>

      <description>In the last article, I tried to cover almost every point required for creating your blog. However, there are still some points left which remain uncovered in the previous section.
This article will cover those points which I feel are not covered in the official documentation or if covered are not much focussed in there quick start guide.
Point 1 Most of the time I read questions on the internet of people asking that even after creating or copying the config.</description>
